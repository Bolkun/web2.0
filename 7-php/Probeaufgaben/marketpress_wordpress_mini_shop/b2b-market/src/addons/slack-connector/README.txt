== Description ==
Connect WordPress and Slack - with the Slack Connector. The plugin offers you and your team all conditions to always be informed about all activities on your blog, shop and forum. And to perfectly optimize your processes.

Whether orders from WooCommerce are forwarded to a specific channel, or to get informed about new topics from bbPress-forums, or about comments and posts from your blog: Slack Connector offers you endless possibilities to automate your stream of messages. 

= Features =
* WooCommerce: You can create a notification for new orders, which can be filtered individually. Get Notifications for a specific product, for a product category or for all products. Further messages are possible for new reviews, for products low in stock or out of stock, or when a new customer registers on your shop.

* bbPress: You can limit notifications to single forums, or to private topics and forums. For a better overview, the Slack Connector displays the bbPress Gravatar. That way you can quickly identify who send the particular message.

* WordPress: Blog posts that are transferred to Slack can be filtered by categories. In Slack you see the content of the post, or an excerpt of the content, as well as the blog post image. Comments can also be filtered by category, or you set the notifications only for specific posts.
